 <h1 id="s00">I. Introduction</h1>

 <h2 id="s01">Preamble</h2>

 <p>uniLETIM was originally created as internet application designed to an administration of LETS
 group and by the later requests also for TimeBank administration. When you use or prepare to use
 this application, probably you know what is LETS or TimeBank. If not, you can find more
 informations <a href="#s06">here</a>.</p>

 <p>uniLETIM enables administration of users, collecting and sorting of offers and queries and
 recording of performed services. The application works in the internet browser environment. It
 enables displaying of informations on the screen or printer-compatible formating. Application
 works in three modes:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>LETS - multi-user mode</li>

  <li>Time Bank</li>

  <li>LETS - single-user mode</li>
 </ol>

 <p>LETS - multi-user mode enables administration of data, announces or service records for all
 members. This mode is suitable to use in the internet environment, where every user can access to
 his data and modify them. In the Time Bank there is usually one administrator, who serves data
 inserting and creating of outputs. For that needs it was created a mode for installation on a
 single local computer without network connection. That mode is usable also for LETS groups, where
 the majority of members does not have access to internet.</p>

 <p>Programming language:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>the application is written in PHP language, by which the server generates HTML pages with
  outputs</li>
 </ul>

 <p>The application is available in two versions:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>uniLETIM-standalone</li>

  <li>uniLETIM-full</li>
 </ol>

 <p><b>uniLETIM-standalone</b> package contains just a single uniLETIM application. This version is
 usable for internet server or single computer, which has installed an http-server with PHP and
 MySQL support.</p>

 <p><b>uniLETIM-full</b> package contains also the installation batch files for Microsoft Windows
 operating system and it is determinated for single computer, which is not connected to internet
 and does not have a http-server with PHP and MySQL installed. This package is advisable for users,
 who do not have experiences with installation of that applications and which need just install the
 complete application environment by one click.</p>

 <p><b>uniLETIM-full</b> instalation contains:</p>

 <ul>
  <li><b>uniLETIM</b> - application PHP scripts</li>

  <li><b>PHP 4</b> - enables the running of PHP scripts on the server</li>

  <li><b>Apache HTTP Server</b> - www-server</li>

  <li><b>mySQL</b> - database which saves the data used by uniLETIM</li>
 </ul>

 <p>Apache+PHP+mySQL installation is based on
 <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phptriad">PHPtriad</a> project. You can read about the
 license terms for Apache HTTP server, PHP and mySQL on <a href="licencie.htm">tu</a>.</p>

 <p>This application is "free software", which is referred to <a href="gpl_sk.html">General public
 license GNU</a>. The freedom means that it is freely distributable (with source code), and you can
 freely modify and use it's content in another programs (if they are also distributed under
 GNU/GPL). It enables free sharing of knowledges and effort outcomes between the software creators,
 which creates social relations based on cooperation more than on competition. By the way it is
 also the target of LETSystems and TimeBanks creating.</p>

 <p>We did not find any application with comparable features of use.</p>

 <h2 id="s21">1. Installation of application</h2>

 <p>You can run the uniLETIM installation by starting the "uniletim-full-X.XX.exe" file (where XX

 (for example: "uniletim-update-0.92b.exe"), which you can find here:</p>

 <blockquote>
  <p>
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66618">sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=66618</a></p>
 </blockquote>

 <p>Choose the language of the installation dialogs and click the "Install" button. After the
 updating process click the "Close" button.</p>

 <h1 id="s30">IV. Usage</h1>

 <h2 id="s31">1. Group creating</h2>

 <p>After the first starting of the program (after installation) the form for the new group
 creating will be displayed. It is necessary to insert all required data (name of the group, kind
 of group, group administrator user name, password, password confirmation).</p>

 <p>If you want to create another group, start the"C:\Program Files\uniletim\install.bat" file.</p>

 <div class="ppnadpis">
  Name of the group
 </div>

 <p>uniLETIM program enables to administrate more exchange groups independently. Every new group
 needs different name.</p>

 <div id="s311" class="ppnadpis">
  Group types:
 </div>

 <dl>
  <dt style="font-style: italic">Time Bank</dt>

  <dd>When you create a TimeBank group, you will not have a possibility to set a price in the
  announces. The price will be set just in the paying order and will be determinated in hours. This
  kind of group is determinated to use on a local computer. All functions connected to uniLETIM
  usage in the TimeBank mode are enable just for one user - an administrator.</dd>

  <dt>LETS</dt>

  <dd>
   The members of the LETS groups can determinate the price of their offered goods and services in
   the LETS currency. In the filling of the paying order the inserted price will be also
   determinated in the LETS currency.<br />

   <ul>
    <li><i>single-user mode</i><br />
    is suitable for the applications, where one person - the administrator of the group - will
    execute all operations.</li>

    <li><i>multi-user mode</i><br />
    is sutiable for the applications, where more persons with their own identity will access to the
    data. In this mode every member of the lets-group can access to his data, administrate his
    announces and personal data, submit his paying orders, read the announces, the list of members
    and the realized payments. The administrators can also create new sections, subsections and
    accounts for new members.</li>
   </ul>
  </dd>
 </dl>

 <div class="ppnadpis">
  Group administrator / User name / Password / Password confirmation:
 </div>

 <p>Every group has at least one administrator (look at group types <a href="#s311"
 title="move to the Group modes">higher</a>). Insert your user (login) name and a password. Confirm
 the password. You will need your user name and password for the work with uniLETIM.</p>
